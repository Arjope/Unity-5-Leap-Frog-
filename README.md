For my iteration/game design tool, I decided to make it so that the only way a player can score is by jumping over the other player but only from a raised platform. In other words, you can only score when jumping from one of the walls in the level. The players' trigger colliders were raised up higher to accomplish this. I think it adds a cool, new dyanmic to the game. I also tried to design the level so that there's no hiding. The players can be jumped in any part of the map. So you can't just sit in the corner. Players can even use the outer walls as surfaces to jump from.

For Unity 6 assignment, I added score keeping functionality to the GUI for both players. I also added a win notification to the center of the screen whenever one of the players reaches a score of 4.
